🌽 Simulated Corn Yield Analysis (ANOVA)

## Goal: To design and execute statistical simulations using Python and R to evaluate agricultural yield variance under varying environmental conditions, specifically applying Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to quantify the impact of experimental factors.

# Methods:
  - Tools: Python (Pandas, SciPy, Statsmodels), R, Jupyter Notebooks.
  - Techniques: Data Simulation, One-way & Two-way ANOVA, Hypothesis Testing, Post-hoc Analysis (Tukey's HSD), Data Visualization.

# Key Findings: 
  - Factor Analysis: Successfully isolated specific environmental variables (e.g., fertilizer type, planting density) that had a                                  statistically significant impact on yield.
  - Variance Interpretation: Quantified the variance within and between experimental groups to validate production consistency.
  - Agricultural Insight: Demonstrated how statistical modeling can predict optimal growing conditions to potentially maximize crop output.
